			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>

                <p>Changing Content : I will be dynamically changing the text content (textContent) and styles (style.backgroundColor) 
                based on the health dimension. And the scripture is updated based on the health dimension, and it's displayed separately.</p>
                <p>Filtering : When the user types in the search bar, it dynamically filters the health dimensions and updates the displayed 
                content based on the search tags.</p>
                <p>Randomizing Health Dimensions : A random health dimension is selected and displayed when the page loads or when triggered.</p>
                <p>Tags : Tags are dynamically added to the page based on health dimensions. When a tag is clicked, it triggers the search for 
                dimensions associated with that keyword, filtering the content accordingly.</p>
                <p>Buttom : When the user clicks the button, a new link is dynamically created and displayed. In contact us page after the user clicks the submit button, 
				a message of submision will be displayed.</p>
                <p>Conditional Logic (If/Else) : This condition checks if there are no filtered results from the search and displays a message accordingly.</p>
                <p>I will use an Array of Health Dimensions</p>
